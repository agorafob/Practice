Design and implement simple Java program to find specific strings in a large text.
The program should be composed of following modules:

  1)The Main module - reads a large text file in parts (e.g. lines in each part) and sends each part(as string)
  to a Matcher. After all matchers completed, it calls the Aggregator to combine and print the results
  2)The Matcher - gets a text as input and searches for matches of a given set of strings.
  The result is a map from a word to its location(s) in a text
  3)The Aggregator - aggregates the results from all the matchers and prints the results.
